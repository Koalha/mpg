# Day 1

## Scripting vs. Point-And-Click
```{r, out.width="800px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pointclick.png")
```

## Scripting vs. Point-And-Click
```{r, out.width="800px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("scripting.png")
```

## Advantages of writing scripts
1. Reproducibility
2. Reusability
3. Automation of repetitive tasks

# There is no replacement for writing code yourself

## There is no replacement for writing code yourself
Writing code enables your brain to connect what you are trying to do to the code you are writing.

NEVER copy-paste code from materials to your scripts. ALWAYS type.

There are multiple ways of doing things. We encourage you to explore them.

<div class="notes">
What this means is that we don't always teach the most effective way of doing things, because first you have to learn the basics.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rlogo.svg")
```

##  What is R?
- Programming language
- Environment for statistical computations
- Free software
- Our tool

## Success of R
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="800px"}
d <- data.frame(Year = 2011:2016,
                Citations = c(1230,1950,5130,11700,20200,32000),
                Packages = c(912,1150,1330,1604,1832,2258))
par(mfrow = c(1,2), cex=0.75)
plot(Citations~Year, data = d,type = "l",main = "New citations of R", axes = FALSE, xlab = "", ylim = c(0,30000),ylab = "")
axis(1,at = d$Year, labels = d$Year, las = 2)
axis(2,at = c(0,10000,20000,30000), las = 2)
plot(Packages~Year, data = d,type = "l",main = "New packages accepted to CRAN", axes = FALSE, ylim = c(0,3000), xlab = "", ylab = "")
axis(1,at = d$Year, labels = d$Year, las = 2)
axis(2,at = c(0,750,1500,2250,3000), las = 2)
```

## Success of R
